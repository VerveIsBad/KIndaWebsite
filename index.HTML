            <h1>About me.</h1>
            <p>Hi! i am Christopher Truluck, a <i>aspiring</i> Software Engineer, though I problly won't make it ;-;</p>
            <p>But enough about that, here some stuff aout me: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm 14</li>
                <li>I'm kinda anti-social; depends on who im with</li>
            </ul>
            <div id="main content in about me">
                <p>I currently am familiar with the folowing languages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python 3</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I know those languages, but i am the most familiar with Python.</p>
                <p>I plan on using my Python skills for back-end development with Flask/sockets.</p>
                <p>I learned Java mostly for minecraft modding, as i am not a fan of it's syntax, i know the basics. I would prefer to not use it.</p>
                <p>When i have time, I also plan on learning a few languages, here are some:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>Jquery</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>Swift</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Those are the one's worth mentioning atleast.
                    Anyways, though i'm not very good at programming, I try to make my code: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Formated properly</li>
                    <li>Effiencient</li>
                    <li>Easy to read.</li>
                    <li>And finally, Unique.</li> 
                </ol>
                <p>I strive to offer unique solutions to prolems that may have never been seen before.
                    Maybe i can't quite do that yet, I try though, even if it's above my skill level.
